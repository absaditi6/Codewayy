Task 1

What are git and GitHub?

Git is Distributed Version Control System.This means that every user will have their own copy of program at their local repository along with having it on the remote repository.It is free and open source.

Github is a web service which implements the remote repository.



Why GitHub is so popular and used in most of the projects?

Github uses Trunk Based Development.This implies that the user can work on different versions/branches and merge them together.
As it is Distributed Version control System so if the remote server fails then the users data would not be lost as it is already available in the local repository.




What are the other platforms similar to GitHub?
Bitbucket 
SourceForge
